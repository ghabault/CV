    {Summary}
    {\begin{justify}
    \quad The network ecosystem offers a diversity of Access Networks (ANs) for devices to connect to. Currently, devices select the AN based on its physical characteristics. However, the best AN satisfying this selection may not be the most suitable one for all services. In addition, the arrival of new constrained devices with the Internet of Things requires that the connection process should be specified for them to benefit from this AN diversity. We proposed a generic, lightweight and service-based announcement mechanism, allowing any device to efficiently select, and so, connect to the best AN for each service. Our mechanism helps Service Providers announce their services on existing networks and helps devices filter ANs based on service availability. Both the impact and effectiveness of this mechanism has been studied on a Machine-to-Machine scenario using simulations and mathematical models.
